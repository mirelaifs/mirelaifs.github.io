I am a software engineer and a personal coach passionate about finding balance in life. 

In my search for life balance, I came across two techniques that improved my life tremendously: 
[Self-Leadership](https://ifs-institute.com/) model and [Co-active Coaching](https://www.coactive.com/about/what-is-coactive).

I am a [Certified Professional Co-Active Coach (CPCC)](https://www.credly.com/badges/655d780c-f0ac-4ea2-a0b9-0a313a92ccbe/embedded)  and IFS trained, offering consultations in both English and Romanian.

[Contact me](./2023/03/24/contact.html) for a first free video consultation(30 min) to assess if we can work with each other.
